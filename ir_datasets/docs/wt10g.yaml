WT10G web document collection. Used for early TREC Web Tracks. Not to be confused with
<a class="ds-ref">wt2g</a>.
</p>
<p>
The dataset is obtained for a fee from UoG, and is shipped as a hard drive. More information
is provided <a href="http://ir.dcs.gla.ac.uk/test_collections/access_to_data.html">here</a>.

<p>
To use this dataset, you need a copy of <a href="http://ir.dcs.gla.ac.uk/test_collections/access_to_data.html">WT10G</a>,
provided by the University of Glasgow.
</p>
<p>
Your organization may already have a copy. If this is the case, you may only need to complete a new
"Individual Argeement". Otherwise, your organization will need to file the "Organizational agreement"
and pay a fee to UoG to get a copy. The data are provided as hard drives that are shipped to you.
</p>
<p>
Once you have the data, ir_datasets will need the directories that look like the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li><kbd>WTX001</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>WTX002</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>...</kbd></li>
</ul>
<p>
ir_datasets expects the above directories to be copied/linked under <kbd>~/.ir_datasets/wt10g/corpus</kbd>.
